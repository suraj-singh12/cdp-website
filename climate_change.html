    <h1> Climate Change </h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Climate change is the phenomenon of climatic transformation of a particular region or of the
            entire earth, characterized by the changes in the usual temperature, precipitation pattern and wind
            flow and other weather parameters. Climate change may occur due to natural internal processes
            or external forcing such as moderation of the solar cycles, volcanic eruptions, and persistent
            anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change refers to all form of climatic inconsistency regardless of their statistical nature,
            recently Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as “any
            change in climate over time whether due to natural variability or a result of human activity”
            (2007). Significant changes in temperature and rainfall are already evident in many parts of the
            world (2001). India recognized as one of the most susceptible countries in the world due to
            climate change and its climate is becoming more unpredictable every year (World Bank, 2000).
            Climate induced hazards, like floods, cyclones, droughts, riverbank erosion, storm surges and
            others are aggravated and its variability being experienced more frequently than ever before
            2007. The low-lying topography, funnel shaped coast exposing the land to cyclones and tidal
            surges, seasonal flooding, widespread poverty, large population base, poor institutional
            development have particularly made our country highly vulnerable to climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our main motive is to create and awareness among the people about the sustainable agricultural
            process and deal with climate changes.

        <h2>Problem identification and causes of the problem</h2>
        <p>
            West Bengal, located at eastern part of India, has a hot and humid monsoon type of climate.
            According to the variations of the elements (temperature, rainfall etc.) the climate of Wet Bengal
            can be divided into four seasons, namely, 1) Summer (March- June), 2) Monsoon (JulySeptember), 3) Autumn
            (October- November), and 4)Winter (December- February). In every
            season in West Bengal there are different types of crops that are being planted and some are
            being harvested. Climate plays a very important role in agriculture. And these anthropogenic or
            natural reasons that causing the climate change has a major impact on crop cycle of West
            Bengal. Broadly, these are changes in rainfall, changes in fishing patterns, rise in sea level,
            frequency and intensity of extreme climatic events, and heightened land erosion. These were the
            recurrent issues that need concern.

        <h2>Objctives to be achieved</h2>
        <p>
            Climate change refers to any change in climate elements like temperature, precipitation,
            atmospheric gases, solar radiation, over a period of time, whether due to natural variability or as
            a result of human activity. Any permanent change in weather phenomena from the normal of a
            long period average is referred as climate change. The Earth’s climate is constantly changing as a
            result of natural processes. The global temperature increased by 2.0–3.0°C and increased in CO2
            from 180 ppm to 350 ppm. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) trap some of the energy and the Earth
            releases it to space. The GHGs in the atmosphere act as a thermostat controlling the Earth’s
            climate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, the objectives of the study to combat the adverse effect of climate change identifying the
            specific problems and adoption of remedial measures for protection and environmental hazards
            and to prevent economic loss of the common people. And also educating people and spreading awareness to
            prevent upcoming natural resource crisis. In this project we mainly focus on the
            agricultural system of West Bengal and the effects of climate on it.
        </p>

        <h2>Various steps taken to achieve the objectives</h2>
        <p>
            Agriculture plays a key role in overall economic and social well being of India. Though the share
            of agriculture in both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employment has declined over time,
            the pace of decline in its share in employment has been much slower than that of GDP. The share
            of agriculture in GDP is declined from 39% in 1983 to 24% in 2000–01 compared with much
            lower rate of decline in its share in total employment from 63% to 57% during the same period.
            Declines in the share of agriculture in GDP were not commensurate with the fall in dependency
            in agriculture. Such trends have resulted in fragmentation and decline in the size of land holdings
            which leads to agronomic inefficiency, a rise in unemployment, and a low volume of marketable
            surplus. These factors could contribute to increase vulnerability to global environmental change.
            In India, average food consumption at present is 550 gm per capita per day whereas the
            corresponding figures in China and USA are 980 gm and 2850 gm respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is now clear evidence for an observed increase in global average temperatures and change
            in rainfall rates during the 20th century. The most important climatic changes in recent times is
            the increase in the atmospheric temperatures due to increased levels of greenhouse gases such as
            carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), ozone (O3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and chloro-fluoro
            carbons (CFCs).
        </p>
        <p>
            Causes of climate change are as follows :
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Burning of fossil fuels, Industrialization, Urbanization, automobiles,
            </li>
            <li>
                Increased use of refrigerants
            </li>
            <li>
                Deforestation
            </li>
            <li>
                Enhanced agricultural practices and
            </li>
            <li>
                Affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of the earth's surface.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            <strong>Green House Effect :</strong> Green House effect is the phenomenon whereby the earth's atmosphere
            traps solar radiation, and is mediated by the presence in the atmosphere of gases such as carbon
            dioxide, water vapor, and methane that allow incoming sunlight to pass through, but absorb the
            heat radiated back from the earth's surface.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus the Green house gases (GHGs) provide a blanketing effect in the lower strata of the earth’s
            atmosphere, and this blanketing effect is being enhanced because of the human activities like
            burning of fossil fuels etc.
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>
                The Greenhouse Effect plays a crucial role in maintaining a life-sustaining environment
                on the Earth;
            </li>
            <li>
                If there was no Greenhouse Effect, the average temperature of the Earth would have been
                -18oC (253°K) instead of the present 15oC;
            </li>
            <li>
                Human activity is enhancing the natural Greenhouse Effect by adding gases like carbon
                dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, ozone, etc;
            </li>
            <li>
                It is this Enhanced Greenhouse Effect which is causing Global Warming and Climate
                Change.
            </li>
            <li>
                CO2 31% Increased in 200 years & could double by 2035 A.D. Global CO2 levels rise
                approximately 0.4 % each year to levels not experienced on this planet for millions of
                years (Odjugo and Isi, 2003).
            </li>
            <li>
                Burning of fossil fuels, burning of vegetation, coal, cowdung, crop residues, etc. are the
                main causes.
            </li>
            <li>
                CH4 Increase contributed by intensive crop cultivation mainly rice. Addition of organic
                material under submerged conditions of soil.
            </li>
            <li>
                CH4 concentration has risen by about 151% over the last 200 years.
            </li>
            <li>
                Digestive processes of ruminant animals, venting of natural gas and waste decomposition
                are also the sources of CH4 emissions.
            </li>
            <li>
                N2O: Industrial emissions; increased use of inorganic fertilizers, irrational use.
            </li>
            <li>
                N2O levels have increased by 18% in the last 200 years mainly due to more intensive
                agricultural practices.
            </li>

            <strong> Effects of Enhanced CO2 :</strong> Crop species vary in their response to different concentrations
            of
            CO2. Wheat, rice, soybeans, etc., which belongs to C3 plants, respond readily to increased CO2
            levels. Maize, sorghum, millets, sugarcane, which are classified as C4 plants, though more
            efficient photosynthetically than C3 plants at present levels of CO2, they tend to be less
            responsive to enriched concentrations of CO2.

        <h2>Innovativeness and Uniqueness of the Project undertaken</h2>
        <p>
            Beside creating this report, we (me and my classmate Suraj Singh) prepared a website
            providing proper information about agriculture which will help the common men to get more
            conscious about the dos and the don’t in sustainable agricultural methods. In this era of internet, I
            believe websites can spread the fire of awareness in the atmosphere faster than any other mode.
            On publishing this website, it can reach many people out there in our country and that would
            help to enrich their knowledge and we are also planning to make a feedback section or fact
            section in our website where people can post the real facts that can be helpful for others who did
            not know that. With time, the more we develop our skills we’ll try to include more and more
            amazing features to our website.

    <div>
        <h2>Effectiveness of the project</h2>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Used various crop growth models to evaluate climate change impacts on various crops.
                Variables used in the models were temperature, CO2 levels, rainfall, and solar radiation.</li>
            <li>Studies indicate the possibility of loss of 4-5 million tones in wheat production with
                every rise of 10C temperature throughout the growing period season.</li>
            <li>Reductions in yields predicted to be more for rainfed crops than irrigated crops.</li>
            <li>In the case of rice, an increase of 2-4
                0C is predicted to result in a reduction in yields.
                Although additional CO2 can benefit crops, this effect was nullified by increase in
                temperature.
            </li>
            <li>Fertilizer use efficiency in India is generally very low (30-50%). Climate change will
                alter the requirement of fertilizers, and climate warming will lead to a larger emission of
                available nitrogen.

    <div>
        <h3>Impacts on Agriculture</h3>
        <p>
            There is a likelihood of a considerable impact on agricultural land-use due to snow melt,
            availability of irrigation, frequency and intensity of inter- and intra- seasonal droughts and
            floods, soil organic transformation matters, soil erosion and availability of energy as a
            consequence of global warming, impacting agricultural production and hence, the nations food
            security (Okammoto, 2004). Global warming due to greenhouse effect is expected to impact
            hydrological cycle viz. precipitation, evapo-transpiration, soil moisture etc, which would pose
            new challenges for agriculture.
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
            <li>Studies have shown that between 15 to 280C temperature, the available N emission will
                increase by about 4% with 10C temperature rise, and the emission period will be
                shortened to 3.6 days, the application amount of N will be increased by about 8% and
                16% along with 20C and 40C temperature increases, respectively.
            </li>
            <li>Therefore, the fertilizer requirement will increase.</li>
            <li>More irrigation will be required. It is bound to lead to the over-use of the surface and
                underground water resources.
            </li>
            <li>Crop-pest interactions will change significantly.</li>
            <li>Likely to aggravate the heat stress in livestock, adversely affecting their productive and
                reproductive performance. The demand for water, shelter and energy requirement of
                livestock will be increased.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>India's population in 2025 will be about 1.4 billion. India's population in 2040 may
                exceed that of China.
            </li>
            <li>Good cultivated lands are being diverted to urbanization, industrialization, transport
                facilities, etc. Forests are being cut on large scale. Cultivated lands are degrading at a
                faster rate. Water resources are being over exploited.
            </li>
            <li>About 65-70 percent of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.
                The contribution of agriculture and allied sectors to GDP has reduced from 39 percent to
                22 percent during the period of 1979-2004. Its present contribution to the GDP has
                reduced to 16% only.
            </li>
            <li>60 percent of the area sown is dependent on rainfall which is highly unreliable, both in
                time and space. Strong risks of dry spells at critical growth stages. Inter-annual
                fluctuations in rainfall are high.
            </li>
            <li>By doubling CO2 concentration: In next 50 years- Average global surface temperature
                may rise 0.6 to 2.50C.
            </li>
            <li>By end of 21st century :- Average global surface temperature may rise 1.4 to 5.80C.</li>
            <li>Sea level rise 09 to 88 cm over 21st century.</li>
            <li>Without interventions, tropical and sub-tropical regions, will suffer decreased yields with
                rise in temperature.
            </li>
            <li>In tropical agricultural areas, the yields of some crops would decrease with even minimal
                increases in temperature because they are near their maximum temperature tolerance.
            </li>
            <li>In mid latitudes, rise in temp by few 0C and the associated rise in CO2 conc. will lead to
                positive responses and generally negative responses with greater warming.
            </li>
