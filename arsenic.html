    <h1>Arsenic Contamination in GroundWater and Its Effects in Agriculture</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is widely distributed in the Earth’s crust. It is found
            in water, air, food, and soil. Arsenic is introduced into soil and groundwater during weathering of
            rocks and minerals followed by subsequent leaching and runoff. It can also be introduced into
            soil and groundwater from anthropogenic sources. Arsenic is emitted into the atmosphere by
            high-temperature processes such as coal-fired power plants, burning vegetation and volcanism.
            In water, particularly groundwater, where there are sulphide mineral deposits and sedimentary
            deposits deriving from volcanic rocks, the concentrations can be significantly elevated. Natural
            low temperature bio-methylation and reduction to arsines also releases arsenic into the
            atmosphere.

            Arsenic (As) toxicity has been recognized for centuries past. Arsenic has become a great concern
            because of its chronic and epidemic effects on human, plant and animal health. Presenting in the
            terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments in various chemical forms, As may cause
            substantial damages to the plant and animal kingdoms. Arsenic contamination in the
            groundwater is becoming more of a threat day by day due to its hazardous effects. Both human
            and plant species are affected by groundwater As contamination.

        <h2>Problem identification and cause of the problem</h2>
        <p>
            Worldwide, nearly 150 million people spanning over 70 countries are affected by As
            contamination. Countries of South and South-East Asia are mainly affected by As and over 110
            million people of these areas are affected by As. Environmental exposure of As through
            contaminated drinking water severely affects human health. In recent decades, large-scale
            groundwater pollution by geogenic sources of As in Bangladesh and India (West Bengal) has
            been detected, which has largely promoted this element into the environment and largely
            contaminated water, soils and crops. Evoked by the risk of As entering the food chain, the
            detection of As-contaminated agricultural soils has renewed interest in studying the dynamics of
            As in the soil environment. Entrance of As into the biological food chain through crops or fodder
            has also been a danger for humans. Groundwater irrigation is chiefly responsible for As
            contamination and its entrance into the food chain through crop

        <h2>Objectives to be achieved</h2>

        <p>
            Though the farmers are already practicing some traditional techniques to mitigate the arsenic
            problems in soils and water, like cultivation of crops which are less affected to arsenic and heavy
            metals pollution, growing hyper accumulating crops and so many practices wherein the modern
            methods are not prevalently used by the farmers due to the lack of scientific validity of these
            techniques, particularly in the context of prevailing socio-economic conditions. Moreover,
            acceptance of these improved practices by the small farmers of this region is an evolutionary
            process and should be intensively proved. Hence, extensive studies need for bio or phytoremediation of heavy
            metals including arsenic contamination for quality marketable agricultural
            produce, which ultimately can realize better crop productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The broad objective of the study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced bioremediation
            techniques in comparison with traditional system towards improving the quality of water for
            irrigation vis-à-vis soil and crop quality improvement in diverse soil types through on-farm field
            experiments with specific objective to make people aware of the arsenic contamination of water
            and its harmful effects on agriculture and educating them on various measures to reduce its effect
            on agriculture.

        <h2>Various steps taken to achieve the objectives</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                A number of crops were grown on dredged spoil (35-108 mg As/kg) from the rivers As
                levels were shown by radishes with 0.8-2.1 mg As /kg dry weight. The order of
                decreasing As accumulation is: radish (1) &gt; grass (0.33) &gt; lettuce (0.26) &gt; carrot (0.17) &gt;
                potato tuber (0.07) &gt; spring wheat grain (0.04).
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Pot and field trials on the effect of applying sewage sludge, containing arsenate, to a
                sandy loam (pH 6) and to a calcareous loam (pH 8) indicated enriched factors that were
                3-4 times greater in the lettuces and rye grass grown on the calcareous loam. The highest
                level of As reached in the crops was 2 mg/kg dry weight in lettuce. The increases in plant
                tissue As concentration were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.01) with soil As for both types of soil.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Application of FYM and P2O5 could resist the release of native arsenic and could be
                lowering down to moderate toxic effect in soil-plant system. Application of Zn has
                reportedly been reduced the concentration of arsenic in summer rice. A large number of
                other significant findings have ensued.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The application of FYM and phosphate was found to have opposing effect on release of
                native and applied As in the contaminated soils, with FYM reducing such release, thereby
                tending to moderate the toxic effect of As in the soil–plant system. Organic manures,
                namely compost, poultry manure, neem cake, etc., have also been examined as
                ameliorants, not only for rice, but for other crops as well (e.g., potato, elephant foot yam),
                with encouraging results.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The crop with less water requirement also might be helpful to lowering down the effect
                of arsenic and its severity. In these backdrops, water productivity of summer rice with
                differential sowing and transplanting dates as its relation with exploitation of
                groundwater with arsenic contamination are to be quantified and to be established. The
                crop those require less water are considered as substitute for the dominant rice-ricefallow sequence in
                the affected areas to minimize the arsenic uptake by food crops where
                signified the importance of crop diversification during summer season. This apart,
                inclusion of pulses /other legumes /green manure crops in the cropping sequence, coupled
                with organic manure addition, was found helpful in moderating arsenic build-up in soil
                and plant parts. Pond-stored water contaminated groundwater was also found to get
                partially decontaminated over time by sedimentation-cum-dilution due to rainfall, and
                conjunctive irrigation using such water bodies reduced the dependence on groundwater
                irrigation.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                The research results also showed that the incorporation of pulse crop(s)/legume(s)/green
                manure coupled with organic/compost in crop sequence(s) would also be helpful in
                moderating the effect of arsenic. BGA (Anabaena sp. and Nostoc sp.) and some bacteria
                were shown the effect having decontamination ability. The tube wells with activated
                alumina are being used to get arsenic free drinking water to mitigate the severity of the
                problem in these areas. Surface water is free from arsenic contamination and safe for use in crop
                cultivation. The efficient of judicious application of intermittent irrigation water
                in summer rice was found effective as integral part of water saving technologies.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Several weed species, identified by the present authors, normally found along with crops
                like rice, potato, jute, mustard, etc., growing on arsenic contaminated soils (2-14 mg
                As/kg soil) and subjected to irrigation (given to the desired crops) with arsenic
                contaminated groundwater, were noted to accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic in
                their biomass.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Vermicompost application reduced the arsenic accumulation in root, shoot and grain of
                rice by 30%, 30% and 75%, respectively, whereas the same application reduced the
                arsenic load in root, shoot and seed of mustard at the rate of 20-25%. FeSO4 (30 kg/ha)
                or ZnSO4 (20 kg/ha) had significant effect on reducing arsenic accumulation in rice or
                mustard.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Arsenic uptake vis-à-vis translocation factor were substantially reduced with higher level
                of phosphorus in the growing media.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Low arsenic accumulating-crops like potato, pumpkin, sesame can be included in ricebased cropping system
                in arsenic exposed areas to bring down the arsenic load in foodchain. Replacement of 25% N-fertilizer by
                FYM along with increased P-application
                reduced arsenic accumulation in the economic produce of wheat, pea, potato and French
                bean.
            </li><br>
            <li>
                Several weed species, identified by earlier research project, normally found along with
                crops like rice, potato, jute, mustard, etc., growing on arsenic contaminated soils (2-14
                mg As/kg soil) and subjected to irrigation (given to the desired crops) with arsenic
                contaminated groundwater, were noted to accumulate considerable amounts of arsenic in
                their biomass.
            </li><br>

        <h2>Effectiveness of the project</h2>
        <p>
            The project successfully brings in front the level of As in different types of crops being sown on
            same soil. This shows how different crops respond to the same arsenic contamination levels and
            which crop would be beneficial to be grown in highly contaminated soils or groundwater.
            According to the results of research: Farmyard manures, compost, neem cake, etc are found to be
            effective on Arsenic and can be easily implemented in small field/crops too. P2O5 and Zn can be
            used in big fields to reduce arsenic toxicity. Crops requiring less water also get less contaminated
            by As, thereby making them a good candidate where there is highly contaminated groundwater.
            The weeds that grow along-with certain crops like potato, rice, etc accumulate high levels of
            arsenic in their biomass, thereby reducing the toxicity of As in water and soil and ultimately in
            the crop. Application of vermicompost and FeSO4 / ZnSO4 also significantly reduces the
            accumulation of As in crops like rice and mustard.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Arsenic toxicity of contaminated drinking water in humans in many parts of the world and India,
            has deservedly received increasing concern. Arsenic toxicity in livestock and other animal
            species like poultry, fish and sea food has been given comparatively much less attention. On the
            other hand, arsenic contamination in agro-ecosystem, which acts as a conduit for the passage of
            the toxicant to human population via food web, came under serious consideration only recently.
            The complex aspects of accumulation of arsenic in the food web vis-à-vis that in drinking water
            alone is necessary for understanding, and its ultimate passage to the human populations. A
            comprehensive approach is necessary to combat the present arsenic crisis. Some of the potential
            remedial options aimed at reducing the toxic effect of arsenic in agricultural systems include
            developing low arsenic accumulating genotypes, optimum conjunctive use of ground and surface
            water (e.g., use of harvested rainwater) irrigation with pond-stored excess rainwater and
            groundwater, recharge of the groundwater resource with rainwater, and enhancing water use
            efficiency for the agricultural crops by way of adopting appropriate soil and irrigation water
            management strategies. Irrigation from adjacent pond or permanent water body, recharged by
            arsenic contaminated shallow tube well, significantly reduce the arsenic load of the irrigation
            water.
